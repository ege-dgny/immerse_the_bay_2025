# Afference x Immerse The Bay

Thank you for collaborating with us this weekend! We cannot wait to see what you all come up with. Inside of the this directory you will find:

- Afference Quick Look VR.zip
    - The sandbox unity project
- BLE IDs.xlsx
    - a spreadsheet corresponding ring sizes (A-E, 1-27) with their corresponding BLE IDs.

# Unity Installation

Recall our prerequisites packages:

- Unity 6000.0.26f1
    - unity hub should auto prompt you to install it with the sandbox .zip
- Android Build Support Module
    - Unity hub -> installs -> add modules -> Android Build Support
- Visual Studio Community with unity extension

Now do:

1) unzip the Afference Quick Look VR
2) install the prerequesites - you can do so by opening the unzipped project.
